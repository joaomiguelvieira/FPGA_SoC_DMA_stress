# Assessing On-Chip High-Performance Interfaces on Xilinx and Intel FPGA-SoC Devices

This repository contains several projects used to assess the performance of the high-performance on-chip interfaces of two Systems on Chip manufactured by Intel (Cyclone V) and Xilinx (ZYNQ 7010).

## Content of this repository

The content of this repository is as follows:
* `./intel/` contains the files to build the projects for the Intel Cyclone V device (Terasic DE1-SoC board).
* `./xilinx/` contains the files to build the projects for the Xilinx ZYNQ 7010 device (Digilent Zybo board).
* `./report/` contains the project report as well as spreadsheets containing the raw data of the results, scripts to process those results, images, graphics, and tables.

Each subdirectory contains specific information on how to compile and run the projects for each board.
